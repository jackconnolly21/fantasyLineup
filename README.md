ESPN Fantasy Basketball Daily Lineup Automator

This is my script to set my ESPN Fantasy Basketball lineup daily. Not fully automative as it does not add players off 
the bench and into the starting lineup if all the spots are taken, and of course, the players in those spots have games.
In that case, the script sends me an email with the names of the players who were unable to be added to the lineup. I could
implement that functionality but my implementation includes comparing the stats of the players. However, I do not trust stats,
as they do not really tell which player is better in my opinion. I'd rather just set the lineup myself. Another missing functionality you might wonder why I did not implement is the option to set your lineup for a certain amount of days. I did not include this functionality because the leagues that I am in are considered 'deep' which means it includes a lot of people (10+). For deep leagues, people constantly add/drop players, so including this functionality would not make sense as adding/dropping players affects your the setup of your lineup for future days as well. I am probably missing other functinonality as this was just a simple project for me to learn Python as its the first actual 'thing' I coded in Python.
