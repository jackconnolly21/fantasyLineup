ESPN Fantasy Basketball Daily Lineup Automator

This is my script to set my ESPN Fantasy Basketball lineup daily. Not fully automative as it does not add players off 
the bench and into the starting lineup if all the spots are taken, and of course, the players in those spots have games.
In that case, the script sends me an email with the names of the players who were unable to be added to the lineup. I could
implement that functionality but my implementation includes comparing the stats of the players. However, I do not trust stats,
as they do not really tell which player is better in my opinion. I'd rather just set the lineup myself.
